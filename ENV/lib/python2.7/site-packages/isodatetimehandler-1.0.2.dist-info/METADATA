        An alternate jsonpickle handler for datetime
        ============================================
        
        This ``jsonpickle`` handler serializes ``datetime.datetime``
        objects as ISO-8601 formatted strings.  Such strings may be
        treated as a ``DATETIME`` type in a RDBMS such as SQLite
        allowing date-related query clauses to work with serialized
        datetime objects directly.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install isodatetimehandler
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import isodatetimehandler
        
        Then use ``jsonpickle`` as you normally would.
